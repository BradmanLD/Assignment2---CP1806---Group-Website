				<h2><a href="../index.html" class="remove-lines">The Barrier Reef Orchestra</a> Invests $34,000 in New Harp</h2>
				<p>The $34,000 instrument is the newest addition to the <a href="../index.html">Barrier Reef Orchestra's</a> repertoire, and <a href="../artists.html">Leah Li</a> say it's a privilege each time she gets to play it. She said "It is a beautiful harp, it has a very very beautiful sound". The harp weight 30 kilgorams and has 47 strings. <a href="../artists.html">Leah</a> likens the string to the white keys on a piano, while the pedals are the black keys. At home <a href="../artists.html">Leah</a> practices on a much older harp, but she says it gets the job done.</p>
				
				<blockquote cite="Leah Li" >"I have [had] an old harp for about 15 years now, the sound is really good but mechanically you just need to tune up ... You actually need to tune the harp mechanically becuase there's so many different pins and so many pedals ... [it's] a lot of work to maintain it." - <a href="../artists.html">Leah Li</a></blockquote>
				
				<p><a href="../index.html">Orchestra</a> <a href="../committee_and_supporters.html">president Andrew Ryder</a> says the harp is a great addition to the ensemble; previously they had to hire a harp and fly a harpist up especially for their <a href="../events.html">performances</a>. Luckily <a href="../artists.html">Leah</a> had just moved to Townsville whent he <a href="../index.html">Orchestra</a> purchased the harp.</p>
				
				<blockquote>"It's a wonderful instrument visually but of course the sound of the harp is just fantastic live ... It's immediately identifiable and it adds so much to the Orchestra ... we wish it would come with a truck as well to move it around" - <a href="../committee_and_supporters.html">Andrew Ryder</a></blockquote>
				
				<p>The <a href="../index.html">Barrier Reef Orchestra's</a> first <a href="../events.html">performance</a> from the year is this Sunday, Mrach 29th at the Townsville Civic Theatre, and will feature <a href="../artists.html">Leah Li</a> on the harp and flute player <a href="../artists">Jennifer Bradstreet</a></p>
