<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>

    <li><strong>Simranjeet: </strong> Didn't help, the last time I had contact with him was 3 weeks ago when we arranged a meeting for the next day, which he didn't attend.</li>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The way the team came together early on and decided on the preferred communication methods for each member. Additionally it was great how quickly Tobi (Akintobi) and I were able to organize meetings, which either of us didn't miss or were late to. - BradmanLD</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> The fact that I was left alone to do the majority of the assessment as no one was contributing until the week each milestone was due at which point it was too late to change anything or reorganize the work for multiple people to contribute. There were also meetings early on were neither team memeber came prepared to discuss the assessment and quickly derailed the conversation leaving me to work on the assessment. - BradmanLD </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> The way Tobi (Akintobi) and I were able to communicate effectively over slack and text messages to ensure that while he didn't do as much work he certainly had a noticeable contribution. - BradmanLD</p>
